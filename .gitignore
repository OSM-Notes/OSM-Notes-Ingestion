# =====================================================
# Test Artifacts and Generated Files
# =====================================================
# The following patterns ensure that test output files,
# generated mock data, and temporary processing files
# are not committed to the repository while preserving
# the actual test fixtures and source code.
#
# Test fixtures (KEEP):
# - tests/fixtures/xml/mockPlanetDump.osn.xml
# - tests/fixtures/sample_data.sql
# - tests/fixtures/special_cases/*.xml
#
# Generated files (IGNORE):
# - tests/output/mock_*.csv
# - tests/output/parallel_parts/
# - tests/output/workflow/
# - Any file with .corrupted.* or .recovery suffix
# Ignore submodule untracked files
# Note: Submodules should NOT be in .gitignore
# lib/osm-common/

# GeoJSON backup files (uncompressed versions)
# Compressed versions are stored in OSM-Notes-Data repository
data/countries.geojson
data/maritimes.geojson
data/countries.geojson.gz
data/maritimes.geojson.gz

# Node.js dependencies
node_modules/

# Test output failure logs
test_output_failures/

# Output directories and files
output/
output_*.log

# Configuration files with sensitive data (keep templates)
# Real configuration files (ignored - use .example files as templates)
etc/properties.sh
etc/wms.properties.sh
# Local override files (also ignored)
etc/properties.sh_local
etc/wms.properties.sh_local

# Note location backups and generated CSV files
# These are generated backups that can be recreated when needed
# The compressed backup is downloaded from OSM-Notes-Data repository when needed
data/noteLocation.csv
data/noteLocation.csv.zip
data/noteLocation_backup_*.csv
data/noteLocation_combined.csv

# EEZ analysis generated files (ignore all CSVs except centroids)
# Centroids file should be included in git as it's stable and necessary
data/eez_analysis/*.csv
!data/eez_analysis/eez_centroids.csv
# Keep LICENSE file (required for CC-BY attribution)
