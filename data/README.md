# Data Directory

## Overview

The `data` directory contains configuration files and reference data used by the
system. Most backup files and large datasets have been migrated to the external
[OSM-Notes-Data](https://github.com/OSMLatam/OSM-Notes-Data) repository to keep
this repository focused on code only. Backup files are automatically downloaded
from GitHub when needed.

## Directory Structure

### `/data/`

Configuration and reference files:

- **`missing_maritime_ids.txt`**: List of missing maritime boundary IDs used by
  the boundary processing functions.
- **`missing_maritime_details.csv`**: Detailed information about missing maritime
  boundaries (analysis file).
- See [Boundaries_Backup.md](../docs/Boundaries_Backup.md) for details on boundaries
  backups and how they are automatically downloaded from the external repository.

## Backup Files Location

Large backup files (boundaries and note locations) are stored in the external
repository:

- **Repository**: [OSM-Notes-Data](https://github.com/OSMLatam/OSM-Notes-Data)
- **Files**: `countries.geojson.gz`, `maritimes.geojson.gz`, `noteLocation.csv.zip`
- **URL**: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OSMLatam/OSM-Notes-Data/main/data/`

These files are automatically downloaded when needed by the processing scripts.
See [Boundaries_Backup.md](../docs/Boundaries_Backup.md) for complete documentation.

## Local Files

The following files may be present locally during development or processing:

- **`countries.geojson`** / **`countries.geojson.gz`**: Local copies of country
  boundaries (generated by export scripts or downloaded from GitHub).
- **`maritimes.geojson`** / **`maritimes.geojson.gz`**: Local copies of maritime
  boundaries (generated by export scripts or downloaded from GitHub).
- **`noteLocation.csv`** / **`noteLocation.csv.zip`**: Local copies of note
  location backups (generated by export scripts or downloaded from GitHub).

These files are ignored by git (see `.gitignore`) and can be safely deleted as
they will be automatically downloaded when needed.

## Usage

This directory provides:

- Configuration files for boundary processing
- Reference data for analysis
- Automatic download of backup files from external repository when needed

## Dependencies

- Data processing tools for CSV and compressed files
- Geographic data handling capabilities
- Network access to download backups from GitHub when needed
